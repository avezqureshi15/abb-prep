// useCallback is a React hook that memoizes a function, ensuring it gets recreated only when its dependencies change.Itâ€™s primarily used to prevent unnecessary re - creation of functions, especially when those functions are passed as props to child components, which could trigger unwanted re - renders.This optimization is helpful in scenarios involving complex components or performance - sensitive applications.
